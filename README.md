## 🎯 **Objective**
The goal of this project is to analyze hospital performance metrics and gain insights into:
- How many patients were admitted and discharged.
- Which wards (ICU, General, Private) have the highest bed occupancy.
- How much total billing and insurance claims were processed.
- Which diagnoses and tests are most common.
- What feedback patients are providing.
- How to improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.

## 📈 **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
| KPI | Description |
|-----|--------------|
| 🧍‍♂️ **Total Patients** | Total number of patients admitted during the period. |
| 🏥 **Bed Occupancy** | Count of occupied beds by ward type (ICU, General, Private). |
| 💰 **Total Bill Amount** | Total hospital billing amount during the selected time period. |
| 🩺 **Total Stay Days** | Total number of patient days across all wards. |
| 📅 **Admit & Discharge Dates** | Timeline filters for patient admissions and discharges. |
| ⭐ **Average Feedback Score** | Average patient satisfaction score (out of 5). |

## 📊 **Dashboard Features**
### 🔹 Bed Occupancy
Shows the number of patients admitted in **ICU, General, and Private wards**.  
➡️ *Insight:* Private wards have the highest occupancy, indicating strong patient preference.

### 🔹 Patient Treatment by Doctor
Displays how many patients were treated by each doctor.  
➡️ *Insight:* Helps identify workload balance and doctor performance.

### 🔹 Patient by Diagnosis
Visualizes top health issues among patients (e.g., Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, etc.).  
➡️ *Insight:* Viral and Flu cases are most common — useful for inventory and staffing.

### 🔹 Patient Test Analysis
Shows how many patients underwent each diagnostic test (Blood Test, MRI, CT Scan, X-Ray, Ultrasound).  
➡️ *Insight:* Blood Tests and MRIs are the most frequently used diagnostics.

### 🔹 Billing vs Insurance Amount
Compares total hospital bills with insurance coverage.  
➡️ *Insight:* Identify gaps where patients pay higher out-of-pocket expenses.

### 🔹 Patient Average Feedback
Displays feedback scores by doctor or department.  
➡️ *Insight:* Overall feedback is high (~4.72/5), showing strong service satisfaction.
